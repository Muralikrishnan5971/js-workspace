    <h1>ES6 Variables</h1>

    <script src="assets/scripts/app.js" type="module"></script>
    <!-- defer keyword is used to execute all of the html before 
    executing the js file. Another way to do this is place the 
    script at the end of the body tag

    Adding type="module" within the script tag, considers the js 
    files as modules. thus we can import and export functions.

    *****
    In a React project we almost never add a script in the html file.
    Because react project almost always use a build process, which as 
    a part of the build process injects these script tags into the html
    code for us.
    
    React project uses a build process. Which means,
    The code you write is not the code that gets executed in the browser.
    Our code is transformed before its handed off to the browser.

    reasons react use a build process
    1. raw unprocessed react code wont execute in the browser
    because react code uses jsx feature.
